# ThirdEye Contracts

This repo contains smart contracts used in our project.

All key functions and logic parts are implemented using smart contracts to demonstrate its power, however in real-life application some of them would be implemented in other way to decrease transactions gas cost, to increase functioning speed, and to improve user experience.
